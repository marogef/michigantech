            <h2>What did all the great presidents have in common?</h2>
            <p>They were all elite networkers. They were able to network with others and get to where they were.  We can all learn from them. Michigan Tech was created so that everyone in the community can have a better opportunity so that they can start or continue networking together and make new connections.  There are so many people who you can meet and share ideas with.</p>

                    <h3>Build genuine, personal connections</h3>
                    <p>
                      Networking events are a bit like being set up on a blind date, and similar rules do apply. Don't take over the conversation and talk about yourself and business. People want to feel that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say. Ask questions to get to know other people and understand what they do. As you build the connection, potential opportunities often present themselves.

                    <h3>Listen</h3>
                    <p>
                          Take a few minutes to listen to the conversation when joining the group. An effective way to make a good first impression is to join a conversation with a comment that shows you actually were listening to the current group. Acknowledge a point to add to the conversation rather than refocusing on you and your work. Nothing will stop a conversation faster. Listening is not just nodding your head and agreeing.  You need to be actively listening and paying attention.

                    <h3>Be Yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best approach for any networking event is to be yourself and talk about yourself in a casual, non-salesy way. When you talk about yourself, always try to share, not sell. You can do a bit of homework on which connections make sense for you to connect with so you can be focusing your energy chatting with the people that you connect with.  What do Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Ellon Musk do when they speak? Do they try to be someone that they are not?
