                   <h2>Important things to remember while you are networking: </h2>

                    <h3>Build genuine, personal connections</h3>
                    <p>
                      Networking events are a bit like being set up on a blind date, and similar rules do apply. Don't take over the conversation and talk about yourself and business. People want to feel that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say. Ask questions to get to know other people and understand what they do. As you build the connection, potential opportunities often present themselves. The key to making the contact feel valued is to pay attention to what he says about his likes, dislikes, hobbies and needs. Then, appropriately apply that knowledge. If you are aware that a contact is participating in a special event for example, make a note of it and follow up to see how the event went. </p>    
                 
                 <p>Okay, so you’ve decided to build the best networks the world has ever seen. You started with your family and moved to your extended family—and their extended family—and then networked up, down and sideways at work. Now what do you do? I would make getting into the next four groups my next step, be it bowling, bridge, or helping kids sell cookies, the power of club membership is far reaching. It will propel your career and change your life. These include: alumni clubs, industry associations, social/golf/athletic clubs and hobbies. They do not need to be software related.  This is networking.  The connections you make within these organizations are on shared interests. You will learn the latest industry gossip at a professional association, don’t discount the value of networking through non-work-related activities. These just widen your horizons and they will make you an invaluable part of other networks!

                    <h3>Listen</h3>
                    <p>
                          Take a few minutes to listen to the conversation when joining the group. An effective way to make a good first impression is to join a conversation with a comment that shows you actually were listening to the current group. Acknowledge a point to add to the conversation rather than refocusing on you and your work. Nothing will stop a conversation faster. Listening is not just nodding your head and agreeing.  You need to be actively listening and paying attention.

 <p>This will differ somewhat by company.</p>
<br>
<li>Effective Behavioral Interviewing</li>
<p>Most behavioral interview questions focus on a few key topics: your work experience, your work style, and how you deal with obstacles. Recruiters and hiring managers ask these questions so that they can determine if you have the skills and experience that they are looking for, if you can work well with others, if you have the necessary communication skills, and what you do when faced with a conflict or setback.</p>
<br>
<p>Preparing for a Behavioral Interview or Initial Phone Screen.</p>
<br>
<p>To prepare for a behavioral interview, spend time on the website of the company you are interviewing for. Try to learn as much as you can about them. What do they build? What tech do they use? What’s their culture like? Has their CEO written anything about the company? </p>
<br>
<h1>Here are some common questions to get in an initial interview.</h1>
    <li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
    <li>Why are you interested in programming?</li>
    <li>What interests you in this role?</li>
    <li>Why do you want to work for this company?</li>
    <li>Tell me about one of your accomplishments.</li>
    <li>Tell me about a project you’ve done that you are proud of.</li>
    <li>Tell me about a challenge you overcame.</li>
    <li>Tell me about a time that you had a conflict with a colleague.</li>
    <li>What’s the most important thing you learned at Thinkful/Bloc?</li>
    <li>What unique qualities do you bring to this team?</li>
    <li>What’s your biggest weakness?</li>
    <li>What’s important to you when thinking about where you work?</li>
    <li>Where do you see yourself in five years?</li><br>
    <h1>Make sure to come prepared with 2-3 questions to ask about the company, role, team, etc. Under no circumstances should you ask zero questions. Some examples of good questions are things like:</h1>

    <li>What are the most important qualities to bring to this role?</li>
    <li>What's the biggest challenge that the team/company is facing right now?</li>
    <li>How is success measured for this role?</li>
    <li>What is your favorite thing about working there? (people love answering this one)</li>

                    <h3>Be Yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best approach for any networking event is to be yourself and talk about yourself in a casual, non-salesy way. When you talk about yourself, always try to share, not sell. You can do a bit of homework on which connections make sense for you to connect with so you can be focusing your energy chatting with the people that you connect with.  What do Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Ellon Musk do when they speak? Do they try to be someone that they are not?
