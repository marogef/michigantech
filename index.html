            <h2>Before you come to the events </h2>

                    <h3>Build genuine personal connections</h3>
                    <p>
                  Networking events are a bit like being set up on a blind date, and similar rules do apply. Don't take over the conversation and talk about yourself and business. People want to feel that you are genuinely interested in what they have to say. Ask questions to get to know other people and understand what they do. As you build the connection, potential opportunities often present themselves. 
                    </p>      
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <a><img class="sec-image" src="global.jpg" alt="global pic"></a>
                    <h3>Listen</h3>
                    <p>
  Take a few minutes to listen to the conversation when joining the group. An effective way to make a good first impression is to join a conversation with a comment that shows you actually were listening to the current group. Acknowledge a point to add to the conversation rather than refocusing on you and your work. Nothing will stop a conversation faster. 
                    </p>
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a><img class="sec-image" src="network.jpg" alt="network pic"></a>
                    <h3>Be Yourself</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best approach for any networking event is to be myself and talk about yourself in a casual, non-salesy way. When I talk about myself, I always try to share, not sell. I also do a bit of homework on which connections make sense for me to connect with so I am focusing my energy chatting with the people that I connect with.
